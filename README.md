# heavenk21 vimrc
heavenk21 vimrc is a simplistic vimrc that emphasises the usage of vim
fundamentals. In addition, there is no dependency among configurations or
plugins unless otherwise stated. Lastly, the vimrc is fully documented and is
thus a good study source for those who want to create their own vimrcs.

NOTE: This vimrc is not optimized for all operating systems nor vim versions.
heavenk21 vimrc is created under the purpose of my personal vim customization.
However, it is not difficult to have all configurations working, especially on
a unix/linux based operating system with a vim version 7.3 or above.
